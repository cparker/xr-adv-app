# July 30th 2016 Lone Star Mine

I started near west magnolia trailhead just N of Nederland on Peak to Peak Hw.
[map]
* Lone Star is really close to trailhead
* A few cool things to see right off the trail.  It is private, so I didn't wander around onto the property
too much
* Catalog from smelting company
* Further down 105
* All the way to Tolland Rd.
* Lakes, are they private or not?
*
